# The Unconfessional üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Js Chillin


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Mohammed Shadin - Government Engineering College, Palakkad

### Project Description
The Unconfessional is like a diary, but with commitment issues, it scrambles every word you write, then makes you play ridiculous mini-games just to read your own thoughts. It‚Äôs perfect for anyone who thinks journaling is too therapeutic and would rather wrestle their keyboard for sport.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
We‚Äôre solving the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù of journaling being way too easy and emotionally rewarding.
With The Unconfessional, you‚Äôll never have to worry about achieving clarity, we‚Äôll scramble your thoughts, dangle them in front of you, and make you win absurd mini-games to get them back. Inner peace? Overrated. Keyboard-induced rage? Now that‚Äôs character building.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
By turning your diary into a chaotic escape room for your own thoughts.
We scramble every letter you type, then guard the original text behind mini-games like Tic-Tac-Toe, number guessing, and memory matches. Win, and you get a fleeting glimpse of your message before it‚Äôs scrambled again. Lose, and you get a one-hour timeout to reflect on your life choices.
